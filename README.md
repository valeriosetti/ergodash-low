# What's this?

This is (another) split keyboard project which starts from the ErgoDash which I'm currently using and tries to adapt it to my preferences.
Some goals are:

- make it smaller by having all switches PCB mounted
- do not use acrylic frame and let the PCB sit directly on the desktop
- use low profile Gateron switches
  - I used KS27, since (a) I already have some at home and (b) I couldn't find mechanical design files for the KS33 for designing a footprint
- add some holes at the corners of the board in order to make it tiltable/adjustable with some screw
